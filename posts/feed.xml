  I peruse a fair amount of dotfile repos, and keep seeing people use short
  flags for things like aliases and inside little command line tools. Short
  flags are a command line shortcut, and they do belong there, but if you're not
  writing the command in a prompt, do yourself (and anyone else that may someday
  be reading your code) a favor and be more verbose, because this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl --silent checkip.dyndns.org \
| grep --extended-regexp --only-matching '[0-9\.]+'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  is a lot easier for a human to understand than this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'&lt;/code&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tim Cook on Sir Jony Ive in a &lt;a href="http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/06/15708290-apple-ceo-tim-cook-announces-plans-to-manufacture-mac-computers-in-usa" title="Read the interview on rockcenter.nbcnews.com"&gt;Rock Center interview&lt;/a&gt; with Brian Williams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jony [Ive, senior vice president of industrial design], who I think has
the best taste of anyone in the world and the best design skills, now has
responsibility for the human interface. I mean, look at our products. (Cook
reaches for his iPhone.) The face of this is the software, right? And the
face of this iPad is the software. So it’s saying, Jony has done a remarkable
job leading our hardware design, so let’s also have Jony responsible for the
software and the look and feel of the software, not the underlying
architecture and so forth, but the look and feel. I don’t think there’s
anybody in the world that has a better taste than he does. So I think he’s
very special. He’s an original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an incredible reputation to have.&lt;/p&gt;
