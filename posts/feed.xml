    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spend a fair amount of time trying to get this shape nailed down in CSS, so
I wanted to share and save someone the time. The secret was in setting the
second set of radii on the &lt;code&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt; property. &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; has a helpful
visual to help wrap your mind around that lesser-known feature of box-shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="codepen" data-height="300" data-type="result" data-href="Edxia" data-user="adamyonk" data-safe="true"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href="http://codepen.io/adamyonk/pen/Edxia"&gt;Check out this Pen!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently started building a Rails 4 app and ran into some hangups when
using strong parameters with nested models and forms. It seems to be lacking
documentation for this specific scenario, so I wanted to share my findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where you have an album that &lt;code&gt;has_many&lt;/code&gt; songs, and you want to be
able to edit both with the same form, you need to add every nested attribute
that you plan to pass through to the &lt;code&gt;params.permit()&lt;/code&gt;. This is the setup that
ended up working for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/adamyonk/5593868.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do you know of a better or easier way? &lt;a href="mailto:adamyonk@me.com?subject=Rails%204,%20Strong%20Parameters,%20and%20Nested%20Forms"&gt;Let me know!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, &lt;a href="http://imageoptim.com" title="ImageOptim — make websites and apps load faster (Mac app)"&gt;ImageOptim&lt;/a&gt; is a great Mac app that uses
several well-known image optimization tools to compress images and help keep
file sizes down and &lt;a href="https://github.com/guard/guard" title="Guard is a command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications."&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; is "a command line tool to easily handle
events on file system modifications." If you've never tried Guard, I'd
encourage you to take some time and check it out. With over &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/search?query=guard-"&gt;150
plugins&lt;/a&gt; now available, there's surely some way that you can
use it to optimize your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to pair the &lt;a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-shell"&gt;guard-shell&lt;/a&gt; gem with ImageOptim to help me
keep my project's image assets compressed and ready for production. Make sure
you have both guard and guard-shell in your Gemfile and set up a watcher in
your Guardfile for new or edited images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/4503714.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An interesting side effect to note is that guard will catch the file change
when ImageOptim is done compressing and re-open it in ImageOptim and continue
this loop untill there's nothing else ImageOptim can compress out of the
image.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
  I peruse a fair amount of dotfile repos, and keep seeing people use short
  flags for things like aliases and inside little command line tools. Short
  flags are a command line shortcut, and they do belong there, but if you're not
  writing the command in a prompt, do yourself (and anyone else that may someday
  be reading your code) a favor and be more verbose, because this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl --silent checkip.dyndns.org \
| grep --extended-regexp --only-matching '[0-9\.]+'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  is a lot easier for a human to understand than this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jony [Ive, senior vice president of industrial design], who I think has
the best taste of anyone in the world and the best design skills, now has
responsibility for the human interface. I mean, look at our products. (Cook
reaches for his iPhone.) The face of this is the software, right? And the
face of this iPad is the software. So it’s saying, Jony has done a remarkable
job leading our hardware design, so let’s also have Jony responsible for the
software and the look and feel of the software, not the underlying
architecture and so forth, but the look and feel. I don’t think there’s
anybody in the world that has a better taste than he does. So I think he’s
very special. He’s an original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an incredible reputation to have.&lt;/p&gt;
