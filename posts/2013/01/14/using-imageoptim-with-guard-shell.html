  <p>For the uninitiated, <a href="http://imageoptim.com" title="ImageOptim — make websites and apps load faster (Mac app)">ImageOptim</a> is a great Mac app that uses
several well-known image optimization tools to compress images and help keep
file sizes down and <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard" title="Guard is a command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications.">Guard</a> is "a command line tool to easily handle
events on file system modifications." If you've never tried Guard, I'd
encourage you to take some time and check it out. With over <a href="https://rubygems.org/search?query=guard-">150
plugins</a> now available, there's surely some way that you can
use it to optimize your workflow.</p>

<p>I like to pair the <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-shell">guard-shell</a> gem with ImageOptim to help me
keep my project's image assets compressed and ready for production. Make sure
you have both guard and guard-shell in your Gemfile and set up a watcher in
your Guardfile for new or edited images:</p>

<p>An interesting side effect to note is that guard will catch the file change
when ImageOptim is done compressing and re-open it in ImageOptim and continue
this loop untill there's nothing else ImageOptim can compress out of the
image.</p>
