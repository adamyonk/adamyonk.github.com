%p
  I peruse a fair amount of dotfile repos, and keep seeing people use short
  flags for things like aliases and inside little command line tools. Short
  flags are a command line shortcut, and they do belong there, but if you're not
  writing the command in a prompt, do yourself (and anyone else that may someday
  be reading your code) a favor and be more verbose, because this:

%code
  curl --silent checkip.dyndns.org \
  | grep --extended-regexp --only-matching '[0-9\.]+'

%p
  is a lot easier for a human to understand than this:

%code
  curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'
