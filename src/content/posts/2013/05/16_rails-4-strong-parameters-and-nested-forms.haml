  I recently started building a Rails 4 app and ran into some hangups when
  using strong parameters with nested models and forms. It seems to be lacking
  documentation for this specific scenario, so I wanted to share my findings.

  In a scenario where you have an album that `has_many` songs, and you want to be
  able to edit both with the same form, you need to add every nested attribute
  that you plan to pass through to the `params.permit()`. This is the setup that
  ended up working for me:

  Do you know of a better or easier way? [Let me know!][email]
