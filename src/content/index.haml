  I'm Adam Jahnke - a developer with [PureCharity][purecharity]. I love
  minimalism. I have a passion for writing clean, concise code and currently
  enjoy writing it in the flavors CoffeeScript and Ruby.

  I talk about some pretty nerdy things on occasion, but if that doesn't scare
  you, I frequent [Twitter][twitter] quite often and write about code and tech
  related things on a [blog][posts]. If you like [code][github], I'll be your
  huckleberry.

  I was born, raised, and fed corn in Nebraska. I'm now married and living in
  Springfield, Missouri with my beautiful wife [Olivia][olivia]. We write on a
  [blog][blog] together.
