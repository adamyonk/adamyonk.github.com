I spend a fair amount of time trying to get this shape nailed down in CSS, so I wanted to share and save someone the time. The secret was in setting the second set of radii on the `box-shadow` property. [MDN][mdn] has a helpful visual to help wrap your mind around that lesser-known feature of box-shadow.
